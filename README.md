This is a silly little demo app for an offline-first course.

# Prerequisite

* You have Docker and Docker-Compose installed (Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, get.docker.com and manual Compose installed for Linux).
* For older Windows and Mac Systems use Docker-Toolbox 

Then navigate to your repo directory and from there run the following:

# Build

```sh
docker-compose build
```
# Start Container

```sh
docker-compose up
```
# Stop Container

```sh
docker-compose down
```
